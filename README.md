# Calculator
A basic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The HTML structure provides the layout with buttons for digits and operations, while CSS styles the interface to make it visually appealing. JavaScript handles the logic, capturing user input, performing calculations, and displaying the results. The project demonstrates how these three technologies work together to create an interactive and functional web application.
